# Secure Keyboards - Android
In this Repository you will find a small Android app that shows how to retrieve the current keyboard identifier of an Android phone. This identifier can be used to allow/disallow specific keyboards. You may want to use this in a context, where privacy is of uttermost importance.

## Features
- **Get Keyboard Identifier**: Retrieve the current identifier
- **Validate Keyboard**: Check if the identifier is contained in a list of allowed keyboards

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open it in Android Studio (or your desired IDE)
3. Run (or build) the app

## Example
Using a Pixel 7 Pro Simulator you should see the following screen when running the app:
